To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: Instruction_In[31:0], Instruction_Addr[31:0], MemData_In[31:0], MemAddr[31:0], Data_Out[31:0], WriteEnable[3:0], clock, reset, Instruction_Read, MemWrite, MemRead.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net IFID/EX_ALUSrcB_reg_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin IFID/AluSrcB_reg_i_2/O, cell IFID/AluSrcB_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net IFID/EX_Byte_reg is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin IFID/Byte_reg_i_2/O, cell IFID/Byte_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net IFID/EX_ImmSigned_reg is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin IFID/ImmSigned_reg_i_2/O, cell IFID/ImmSigned_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net IFID/EX_RegDes_reg_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin IFID/RegDes_reg_i_2/O, cell IFID/RegDes_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net IFID/EX_WriteReg_reg_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin IFID/MemOrAlu_reg_i_2/O, cell IFID/MemOrAlu_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
